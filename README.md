# poly-on-fire-redux
polymer project with redux managing state, deployable to firebase

# Notes to be fleshed out later

* This code was derived from Rob Dobson's github repo - polycast 61
* It was changed only enough to make sure I could control the visibility of components using global state. Note that even 'count' and 'counter' were not changed in the code, making it slightly confusing since it isn't a counter any more.
